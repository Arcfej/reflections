How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I don't have to search through the whole files. The computer does it for me, I just have to read the actual differenties.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

First of all, if I make some errors during changing the code, I can search for it. Or if someone make changes to my
code if we working in a group, I can see right away what he/she changed. Or I can recall an update on an already published
program if it have turned out to be wrong and I can go back to the older version again.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

You can fully control when to commit and all the commits will be a functioning program. Although if you forget to commit,
there will be none at all.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In Git the changes in the files could be related to eachother and one change can affect multiple files.
While in Google Docs the files aren't related to eachother, so it's more effective to save the changes by files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

The 'git log' command is used to list the commit logs, which explains what is changed in the repository, when and by who.
the 'git diff' command is used to list the actual changes between two commits.
