When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working on more than one computer, or working in a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The same reason why we want to commit manualy. The remote has to be consistent and understandable by everyone.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is when in an online git we cloud clone a repository. It contains a refference, link to the original repository.
Clone is a copy of a repository without a reference.
Branches are a different line of commits. A repository can have multiple branches. A cloning clone all the repository's branches.
