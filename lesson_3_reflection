When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working on more than one computer, or working in a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The same reason why we want to commit manualy. The remote has to be consistent and understandable by everyone.
