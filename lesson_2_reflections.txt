What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden folder: .git. It will contain all the commits I make. Why? Becouse I want a repository. (for storing the commits)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


The working directory has all the files for (for example) a project. The repository 
tracking one, some, or all of the files
in the working directory. How? The staging area is the connection between the two. The files in the staging area

is the files the repository tracking. If I make a commit, it saves the staging area 
into the repository.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I only put those files in the staging area, which changes I want to commit at once. And I want to commit only one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If I want to make some changes which maybe won't work, or when we working in a team and every person working on different functions.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

We can understand concepts better through vision. The branch structure is well visible depicted.
