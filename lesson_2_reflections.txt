What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden folder: .git. It will contain all the commits I make. Why? Becouse I want a repository. (for storing the commits)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


The working directory has all the files for (for example) a project. The repository 
tracking one, some, or all of the files
in the working directory. How? The staging area is the connection between the two. The files in the staging area

is the files the repository tracking. If I make a commit, it saves the staging area 
into the repository.
